# RDF/JS Query Specification

The RDF/JS Representation Task Force is a focus group of the [RDFJS Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/).
We strive to design interface specifications with the goal that different JavaScript implementations of RDF concepts can interoperate.

The focus on this interface is to provide a common API for querying RDF data, which can be shared by JS Libraries.

This repository contains documents created by the Representation Task Force.
