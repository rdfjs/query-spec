  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    The scope of this specification is to provide a way to query over quads, as defined in the <a href="http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#quad-interface">RDF/JS: Data model specification</a>.
    Similar to the <a href="http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/">RDF/JS: Data model specification</a>, this is a low-level specification that provides only essential methods for working with query engines.
    High-level interfaces that work with quads can and should be using libraries that implement this interface.
  </p>
  <p>The specification itself consists of a core-part that is the base for all other functions defined.</p>
  <p>Low-level methods are using explicit parameters that cannot be omitted.</p>
  <p>Additional high-level interfaces are outside of the scope of this specification and should be defined elsewhere.</p>

  <p>
    This document provides a specification of an interface for RDF query engines in a JavaScript environment.
	The task force which defines this interface was formed by RDF JavaScript library developers with the wish to make existing
    and future libraries interoperable. This definition strives to provide the minimal necessary
    interface to enable interoperability of RDF querying libraries.
