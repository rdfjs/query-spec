    This document provides a specification of an interface for RDF query engines in a JavaScript environment.
	The task force which defines this interface was formed by RDF JavaScript library developers with the wish to make existing
    and future libraries interoperable. This definition strives to provide the minimal necessary
    interface to enable interoperability of RDF querying libraries.
